# NLU-2023-Labs

This repo contains all the laboratory lectures for the Natural Language Understanding course held at the University of Trento.

## How to prepare the exercises for the exam
The exercises must be delivered using the directory `exam/studentID_name_surname`. In this directory, you will find a folder for each lab `/LAB_{1 to 9}`.

From **lab 1 to 8**, the folders contain 3 files namely `main.py`, `functions.py` and `README.md`.

-  `functions.py`: you have to write all the other required functions (taken from the notebook and/or written on your own) needed to complete the exercise.
-  `main.py`: you have to write the calls to the functions to output the results asked by the exercise.
-  `README.md`: you may want to write a message for us related to your solution (optional).

From **lab 9 to 11**, the folders contain two folders one for part 1 and the other for part 2. Inside them, there are the following files and folders: `main.py`, `functions.py` ,  `utils.py`,  `model.py`,  `README.md`, `/dataset` and `/bin`.

- `utils.py`: you have to put all the functions needed to preprocess and load the dataset
- `model.py`: the class of the model defined in Pytorch.
-  `functions.py`: you have to write all the other required functions (taken from the notebook and/or written on your own) needed to complete the exercise.
- `main.py`: you have to write the calls to the functions needed to output the results asked by the exercise.
- `README.md`: you may want to write a message for us related to your solution (optional).
- `/dataset`: the files of that dataset that you used.
- `/bin`: the binary files of the best models that you have trained.

Furthermore, for each of the three last exercises, you must write a small report using the LaTeX template in the zip folder  `NLU_final_report.zip`. In particular, you have to write a mini-report of **max 1 page** (references, tables and images are excluded from the count). **Reports longer than 1 page will not be evaluated**. The purpose of this is to give you a way to report cleanly the results and give you space to describe what you have done and/or the originality that you have added to the exercise. You can find more detail about the sections and relative content in the LaTeX template.

**Last but not least**, the code has to be **well-written** and **documented** with comments. Furthermore, the script has to **run** without bugs otherwise the exercise will not be evaluated. Jupyter notebooks are not accepted.

## How to deliver the exercises for the exam
To submit your work you have to fill out this [Google form](https://forms.gle/EbAnzrHipWJ9Y6f18). The work must be delivered **7 days before** the date of the session exam that you want to attend. You can do multiple submissions as we will check only the last one.
<br>

## Folders
In the repo `labs`, you can find the notebooks for each lab session and in `solutions` you can find the same notebooks with the solutions.
<br>

The solutions of each lab will be uploaded after the corresponding lab lecture.
