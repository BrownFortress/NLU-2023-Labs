    "\n",
    "In natural language processing, word sense disambiguation (WSD) is the problem of determining which \"sense\" (meaning) of a word is activated by the use of the word in a particular context, a process which appears to be largely unconscious in people. \n",

    "WSD is a natural classification problem: \n",
    "Given a word and its possible senses, as defined by a dictionary, the objective of WSD is to classify an occurrence of the word in context into one or more of its sense classes. The features of the context (such as neighboring words) provide are used as features for classification."
